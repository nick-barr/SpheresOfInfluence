Background
Conway's Game of Life is a classic example of the concept of cellular automata. The original GoL plays out on a rectangular grid. Each cell on the grid is either dead or alive when the game begins. On the next iteration of the game (called a "generation") the cells follow these rules:

1) Any live cell with exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors* stays alive; otherwise, it dies 2) Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors will come to life; otherwise, it remains dead

* A cell's neighbors are the 8 cells that immediately surround it (fewer when you're at an edge or corner)

There are many variations on the GoL. This simulation will incorporate several of those variations, outlined in the Functionality & MVP and Bonus Features sections.

Functionality & MVPs
With this Conway's Game of Life simulator, users will be able to:

Start, pause, and reset the game board
Select squares to be alive in the initial state
Choose from preset demo initial states
Toggle between square, triangular and hexagonal grids with corresponding rule sets
In addition, this project will include:

An About modal describing the background and rules of the game
A production README
Wireframes
wireframe

Nav links include links to this project's Github repo, my LinkedIn and AngelList, and the About modal.
Game controls will include Start, Stop, and Reset buttons as well as a slider to control the speed.
On the right, there will be clickable rectangles used to toggle between color schemes.
On the left, three clickable shapes will be used to toggle between the types of grids available (Bonus)
Additionally, a drop-down will be added to the Controls to toggle between different rule sets (Bonus).
Technologies, Libraries, APIs
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

The Canvas API to render the game board
Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
npm to manage project dependencies
Implementation Timeline
NB:

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Get canvas to show up on the screen, and spend time getting comfortable with the Canvas API. Create Board and Cell classes. Get a grid rendered to the canvas reflecting the initial state of the cells.

Monday: Dedicate this day toward implementing the underlying logic of Conway's Game of Life. Ensure that I can advance a generation and all the cells update appropriately. If time, make sure this is all rendered correctly on the canvas.

Tuesday: If I didn't get to it already, get the cells correctly rendered to the canvas. Make sure they rerender correctly when I advance a generation. Then, focus on user controls: start, stop, reset, and clicking on cells.

Wednesday: Finish implementing user controls, and focus on styling, as well as implementing the different color schemes and nav links. If time, start on bonuses.

Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.

Bonus features
There are many directions this cellular automata engine could eventually go. Some anticipated updates are:

Add options for different grid types
Add multiple choices for starting states that are interesting
